PRIVACY POLICY FOR TRANSCRIPT PRO

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the Transcript Pro Chrome extension.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Transcript Pro is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data necessary for the extension to function:

- YouTube Video Information: When you use Transcript Pro on a YouTube page, the extension accesses information about the current video, including video ID, title, and transcript data.
- Search Queries: When you use the "Find Words" feature, your search terms are processed locally to find matching content in the video transcript.
- Local Storage: The extension temporarily stores transcript data and search results in your browser's local storage to enable functionality between different parts of the extension.

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

All data processing occurs locally on your device. Specifically:

- Transcript data is retrieved directly from YouTube and processed within your browser.
- Search queries are only used locally to find matching content in transcripts.
- No data is sent to our servers or any third-party servers (except YouTube's own servers to retrieve transcript data).
- Data stored in local storage is temporary and only accessible by the Transcript Pro extension.

DATA SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

Transcript Pro does not share any user data with third parties. We do not:

- Collect personal information beyond what's described above
- Send your viewing history or search queries to any servers
- Use analytics or tracking tools to monitor user behavior
- Share any information with advertisers or marketing companies

YOUR RIGHTS

Since all data is processed locally on your device and we don't collect or store personal information on servers, there is no personal data for you to access, modify, or delete from our systems. You can clear your browser's local storage at any time to remove any temporary data stored by the extension.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will post the updated policy within the extension and/or on the Chrome Web Store listing.
